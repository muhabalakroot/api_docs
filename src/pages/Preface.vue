      application to our systems in order to migrate your orders directly once
      checked out from your system.<br />
      In addition, our API gives you the ability to track your packages directly
      from your system via our package tracking services. <br />Our service
      provides you with an API over HTTP POST & GET requests with parameters URL
      encoded into the request and its response is encoded in JSON. It is
      designed to be easy to use and you can implement it in any model computer
      language that allows you generating web requests.<br />All of the
      operation requires bearer token which can be easily received from the API
      once authenticated using the same username and password used to login to
      our system. <br />We strongly recommend to connect to our sandbox API
      (Testing server) to generate some test requests before communication with
      the real system.
